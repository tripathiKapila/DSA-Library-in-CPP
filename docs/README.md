# DSA Library Project

This project is a C++ library that implements various data structures and algorithms. It includes implementations for dynamic arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, graphs, and hash maps.

## Features
- **Dynamic Array:** A resizable array implementation.
- **Linked List:** A singly linked list.
- **Stack:** Implemented on top of the linked list.
- **Queue:** Implemented on top of the linked list.
- **Binary Search Tree:** Basic BST operations and in-order traversal.
- **Graph:** Simple graph using an adjacency list.
- **Hash Map:** A basic hash map with separate chaining.

## Build Instructions
Use CMake to configure and build the project. See the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` for details.
